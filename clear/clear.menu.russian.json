They say you got put on archive duty because you're the laziest agent at the Bureau.$NL;KENT: I'm not- Who says that?$NL;WEST: Everyone.$NL;KENT: Well, now they'll say that about you.$NL;WEST: That's what's so fucked! I'm a good agent! I worked my ass off to get on the Payday task force. I was gonna catch those bastards.$NL;KENT: And how'd that go?$NL;WEST: Show me a list of the best agents in the whole goddamn FBI. I'd bet a million bucks none of them could keep Hector Morales alive.$NL;KENT: But they weren't in charge of the Op. You were. Congratulations.$NL;WEST: I shouldn't be stuck at a desk. It's not fair.$NL;KENT: Listen. I was all gung-ho when I joined the task force, just like you. I was just as pissed when they dumped the Clown Case Files on me, but now, I'm glad they did.$NL;WEST: Why?$NL;KENT: Because I realized, it doesn't matter if you're out in the field or updating dossiers. Both jobs: equally useless.$NL;WEST: I don't...What are you saying?$NL;KENT: I'm saying we'll never catch them.$NL;WEST: Wow. Love that optimism.$NL;KENT: They broke into the Bureau's offices. Twice. They literally walked into our HQ, and we couldn't do a damn thing about it.$NL;WEST: So what then? They'll just run laps around us until they die of old age?$NL;KENT: Oh no, I think they'll get caught. Just not by us.$NL;WEST: By who, then?$NL;KENT: When you stare at the case files as long as I have, you start to see some connections.$NL;WEST: Oh god, is this some Illuminati shit?$NL;KENT: When the Clowns were working with Senator Simmons—$NL;WEST: If. There's no hard evidence that Simmons—$NL;KENT: It's when. Trust me. And when they worked with Simmons, their crimes didn't happen in a vacuum. They got a senator thrown in jail. They stole valuable tech prototypes. They swung an election, for Christ's sake.$NL;WEST: What's your point?$NL;KENT: My point is: when they worked with The Elephant, people got screwed. Powerful people. Washington people.$NL;WEST: And now there's a secret Anti-Payday Committee? Come on.$NL;KENT: No. But there are a whole bunch of politicians and lawmakers who want to see the Gang get theirs. Somebody's going to figure that out. They're gonna connect the dots, and when they do, they'll have an entire shadow network of power at their disposal with one purpose. One goal.$NL;WEST: ...Take down the Payday Gang?$NL;KENT: Take down the Payday Gang.$NL;WEST: I guess there are worse conspiracies.$NL;KENT: My thoughts exactly.$NL;WEST: Oh, by the way, I got an email from some agent named "Stone-"$NL;KENT: She's some newbie fresh out of Quantico.
